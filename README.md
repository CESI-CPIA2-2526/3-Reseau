# Network Engineering Course - 2025

Welcome to the official repository for the Network Engineering module. This repository serves as the central hub for course materials, lab exercises, mock exams, and project tracking.

## Repository Structure

- **01-Fundamentals/**: Theory, cheatsheets, and mini-lessons (OSI, TCP, IP).
- **02-Labs-and-Exercises/**: Practical Packet Tracer labs (Instructions and Solutions).
- **03-Mock-Exams/**: "White Exams" to prepare for the final assessment.
- **04-Project-Management/**: Methodologies, Gantt templates, and PERT analysis guides.
- **Ressources/**: Additional reading materials, external links, and reference documents.

## Evaluation & Grading Scheme

The final grade for this block is composed of continuous assessments, individual practical exams, the official Cisco CCNA certification, and the final project defense.

### (A) Project Milestones (CCTLs)

Throughout the project, you will be evaluated on specific technical implementations associated with the course modules:

1.  **Switching / Ethernet:** Layer 2 configuration and optimization.
2.  **IP Addressing / NAT:** Layer 3 design and translation services.
3.  **High-Level Protocols:** Transport and Application layers (TCP, UDP, DNS).

### (B) Individual Troubleshooting Assessment

**Format:** Individual practical exam on Cisco Packet Tracer.
**Objective:** Diagnose and fix network faults within a limited time.

**Preparation Advice:**
To prepare effectively, you should master diagnostic commands (specifically `show` commands) after every lab session. The "Trouble Tickets" available on the Netacad platform are excellent practice.

**Recommended Netacad Chapters for Review:**

- **Introduction to Networks:** 10.3.5, 13, 17.4, 17.6, 17.7.
- **Switching, Routing, and Wireless Essentials:** 1.2.4 to 1.2.9, 4.4.9, 13.4, 16.

### (C) CCNA 1 Assessment

Passing the **"Introduction to Networks"** final exam is mandatory to validate the academic Cisco semester. This exam is counted as a CCTL (Continuous Control) assessment in your final file.

**Weighting:**

- **50%**: Average of end-of-chapter exams (Make sure to activate and take them on Netacad).
- **50%**: Result of the Final CCNA Exam.

**Success Strategy:** Read chapters carefully, complete all labs, and consistently take the chapter assessments.

### (D) Project Management & Deployment Deliverable

**Deadline:** Submitted the day before the final defense.

This deliverable must demonstrate the effective project management methodology applied during the semester. It must include:

- **Project Tracking:** Evidence of Agile/Waterfall management (Gantt, PERT).
- **Deployment Strategy:** A plan based on the network mapping.
- **Network Mapping (Visio):** See details in the section below.

### (E) Final Defense & Prototype Presentation

**Deadline:** Packet Tracer file (`.pkt`) submitted on the day of the defense.

**Evaluation Criteria:**

1.  **Prototype Demo:** Detailed presentation of the functional Packet Tracer topology.
2.  **Oral Argumentation:** Quality of the technical justification and presentation skills.
3.  **Support:** Based on the grid `Project_Grid_V2.xlsx`.

## Specific Deliverable Requirements

### 1. Network Topology Map (Visio or equivalent)

- **Deadline:** Before the Winter Holiday Break.
- **Objective:** Create a physical and logical map of network equipment and cabling for each building.
- **Requirement:** This validates your understanding of the Three-Tier Architecture (Access - Distribution - Core) and ensures the physical/logical placement of devices is coherent.

### 2. IP Addressing Plan

- **Deadline:** End of PBL Loop 5.
- **Status:** Intermediate Checkpoint (Mandatory).
- **Procedure:**
  1.  Submit the addressing plan.
  2.  **Validation Meeting:** You must review this with the instructor _before_ starting any configuration on Packet Tracer.
  3.  **Goal:** This "Go/No-Go" checkpoint is essential to ensure the consistency of your subnets and allow the project to proceed without major architectural errors later.
